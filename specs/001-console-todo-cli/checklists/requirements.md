# Specification Quality Checklist: Phase 1 - Console Todo CLI

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-01
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)
**Status**: PASSED

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Constitution Compliance

- [x] Principle I (SDD): Spec created before implementation
- [x] Principle II (Reusable Intelligence): Agent Skills documented
- [x] Principle III (Cloud-Native Blueprints): Future mappings declared
- [x] Principle VI (Phase 1 Storage): In-memory only constraint enforced
- [x] Principle VII (Language): English interface specified
- [x] Principle X (Security-First): Input validation requirements included
- [x] Principle XII (Observability): JSON output flag specified
- [x] Principle XIII (Simplicity): Out of scope items clearly listed

## Validation Summary

| Category | Items | Passed | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|--------|
| Content Quality | 4 | 4 | PASS |
| Requirement Completeness | 8 | 8 | PASS |
| Feature Readiness | 4 | 4 | PASS |
| Constitution Compliance | 8 | 8 | PASS |
| **Total** | **24** | **24** | **PASS** |

## Notes

- Spec is ready for `/sp.plan` phase
- No clarifications required - all requirements are unambiguous
- Priorities/categories/due dates explicitly deferred to Phase 2 per YAGNI principle
- Cloud-native mappings declared for future reference
